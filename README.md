# Bullet Hell Game!
I am working alone on this and it's a pain in the backside not gonna lie
Game is incomplete but I hope you get the idea.

Basically here's the controls and the goals

0. How to Run 
    - Just run the main.py file and the window will appear!
1. Controls:
    - Arrow Keys to Move
    - Space Bar to Shoot
2. Goal:
    - Shoot the Red Rectangle until its health depletes to move on to the next phase
    - Try not to get hit by the white rectangles, I didn't add death because I am kind
    - That's really it...

3. Note:
    - You know, I didn't balance anything.
    - So when you reach a new phase just try letting the phase play out.
    - Lol
